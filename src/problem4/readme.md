# Overview

The Scoreboard API module is responsible for managing and updating the top user scores displayed on the website's scoreboard. This module ensures live updates of the scoreboard, allows users to increase their scores through specific actions, and enforces authorization to prevent malicious score manipulation.

# Description

1. User performs a specific action on the website that triggers a score update.

2. The website dispatches an API call to the backend application server to update the user's score.

3. The API server receives the request and authenticates the user to prevent unauthorized score updates.

4. If the user is authenticated, the API server validates the request and updates the user's score based on the action performed.

5. The updated user score is stored in the database.

6. The API server responds to the website with a success message, including the updated user score.

7. The website updates the scoreboard in real-time to reflect the latest scores.

# API Endpoints

Update User Score

-   **Endpoint**: /api/score/update
-   **Method**: POST
-   **Request Body**:
    -   **userId**: Unique identifier of the user.

    -   **message**: A message describing the result of the update.
    -   **userScore**: Updated score of the user.

# Authorization and Security

1. The API server enforces authentication to ensure that only authorized users can update their scores.

2. Authentication can be implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or other secure authentication mechanisms.

3. The API server maintains a user database with unique user identifiers.

4. API endpoints should be protected using middleware to validate and verify user identities before processing score updates.

# Real-time Score Updates

1. Real-time scoreboard updates can be achieved using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) technology.

2. The API server can push score updates to connected clients whenever a score change occurs.

3. Scoreboard clients (website) should establish WebSocket or SSE connections to receive live updates.

# Error Handling

1. The API server should handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages in the response.

2. Common error scenarios to consider include unauthorized requests, invalid actions, and database-related errors.
